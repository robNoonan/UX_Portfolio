			<h1>Tom Noonan <p>UX Architect and Researcher</p></h1>
				<h2><p>Principal UX Specialist, Gravitydrive, Inc.</p></h2>
					<h3>Why I chose UX for a career</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Exposure to poorly-considered products drives me crazy!</li>
								<p>This ensures I'll never lose my desire to create products that consider user tasks and needs. <p>Products that lead a user to make errors and waste time, are a failure on the part of the team that developed it. Understanding your users, their expectations and their usage environment is critical.
							<li>Creating products is exciting work! The chance to make a difference in the lives of people who want and need the products matters to me.</p>
							<li>Working with intelligent and motivated colleagues is how I like to spend my time.</li>
								<p>I enjoy working in collaborative efforts with product managers, developers, designers, writers and other professionals to conceive, design and develop high-quality products. The feeling you get when you deliver something new, that users need and like is worth the blood, sweat and tears.</p>

		   	<h2>User Understanding</h2>
				<p>While virtually any UX task can help understand the user, in this case, I'm talking about work early in the product conceptualization and design process. I'm highlighting only more recent work.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="userunderstanding.html#nurses">Ethnographic study of home health care nurses</a></li>
						<li><a href="userunderstanding.html#concepts">Concept formation and evaluation</a></li>	
						<li><a href="userunderstanding.html#profs">In-office observations and interviews with university professors</a></li>
					</ul>
			<h2>Interaction Design</h2>
				<p>My focus has been on designing screens and workflows that are usable from early web eCommerce to mobile apps.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="interactiondesign.html#Altmetrics">Almetrics</a>
						<li><a href="interactiondesign.html#Authors">Save Authors to List</a>
						<li><a href="interactiondesign.html#SD">ScienceDirect Pay-per-view</a>
					</ul>
			<h2>Usability Testing</h2>
				<p>For my portfolio, I'm defining usability testing broadly to illustrate the breadth and depth of my work</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="usabilitytesting.html#Baseline">Baseline testing and post-visual redesign comparison</a>
						<li><a href="usabilitytesting.html#Style">Remote, unmoderated testing of visual style options for field entry</a>
						<li><a href="usabilitytesting.html#Moderated">Moderated one-on-one testing</a>
					</ul>
